# DIIN_PyTorch

  We followed the idea of DIIN and implemented the code from in Pytorch: https://github.com/YichenGong/Densely-Interactive-Inference-Network

  To implement our code, you can follow the instructions from: https://github.com/YichenGong/Densely-Interactive-Inference-Network to set up environment and download data.
